# IAB PrivacyChain C++ API for State Space

This repository contains a C++ API for use with the [State Space](https://github.com/yahoo/state-space-packaging) reference implementation of the [IAB PrivacyChain](https://github.com/Interative-Advertising-Bureau/PrivacyChain) Technology Specification.  The implementation herein is optimized to perform with Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.  That is the core dependency of the State Space reference implementation of the IAB PrivacyChain Technology Specification.

The main body of documentation for the State Space reference implementation of the IAB PrivacyChain Technology Specification can be found with the [packaging](https://github.com/yahoo/state-space-packaging]).  The overview and administrative declarations herein are necessarily summary in nature. The declarations and definitions in the packaging area are complete and should be interpreted as superceding these when the two are in conflict.

This repo supports the State Space reference implementation of the IAB PrivacyChain Technology Specification.

## Background

The [IAB PrivacyChain](https://github.com/Interactive-Advertising-Bureau/PrivacyChain) provides an API service and a distributed, blockchain platform, based on a shared, immutable, distributed ledger (a database). This ledger (database) ensures that participants in a PrivacyChain have a single, consistent, up-to-date view to a consumers consent choices.  The system consists of two components, the "Northside" or "Northbound" service interface and the "Southside" or "Southbound" service interface.  This repository provides portions of the "Southbound" interface towards the Hyperledger Fabric database.

### The "Northside" Services

The "Northside" Services or "Northbound" API offers a REST API to create, update and revoke consent records pertaining to a data subject.  The current generation of API is specified in [PC-11 REST API](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/PrivacyChain/blob/master/design/PC-11_REST-API.md).

Examples of components implementing this interface are [Apanolio](https://github.com/yahoo/tunitas-apanolio) and [Montara](https://github.com/yahoo/tunitas-montara).

### The "Southside" Service

The "Southside Services" or "Southbound Interface" offers database access to a number of database technology.  The expected and preferred database technology, of course, is the distributed shared ledger database of the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric).

This repo provides a client library (a.k.a. a "software development kit") which implements the soutbound interface into Hyperledger Fabric.  It requires the [Hyperledger Fabric C++ SDK](https://github.com/yahoo/hyperledger-fabric-sdk-c++).  The components in this repository provide domain-specific interfaces to the underlying database. These features include schema versioning and evolution as well as the ability to process different consent representations.  The current consent representation is the [IAB Transparency and Consent Framework](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework) as encoded for [Version 1.1](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v1.1%20Final.md).

## Dependencies

The [configuration](#configuration) step will check for many but not all required packages and operating system features.  There is a list of known [package-dependencies](https://github.com/yahoo/PrivacyChain-sdk-c++/blob/master/PACKAGES.md) which you will need to install beyond your base operating system.

Generally, the dependencies are among:
- The Hyperledger Fabric database and its Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) services.
- Various components of the Tunitas system; <em>e.g.</em> the [Basic Components](https://github.com/yahoo/tunitas-basic).
- A modern (C++2a) development environment.
- A recent Fedora, but any recent Linux distro should suffice.

The State Space project was developed on Fedora 27 through Fedora 30 using GCC 7 and GCC 8 with `-fconcepts` and at least `-std=c++1z`.  More details on the development environment and the build system can be found in [temerarious-flagship](https://github.com/yahoo/temerarious-flagship/blob/master/README.md).

## Installation

You may install this repo and its dependents by running the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yahoo/PrivacyChain-sdk-c++.git
```

This will create a directory called `PrivacyChain-sdk-c++` and download the contents of this repo to it.

You may find that your organization or your operating system does not allow punctuation in repository names.  The available resource may therefore be named `PrivacyChain-sdk-cxx`.  Use your good judgement.

The expected application for the `PrivacyChain-sdk-c++` repo is as a submodule of a larger build of the State Space reference implementation of IAB PrivacyChain Techology Specification.  The configuration, build, and installation intructions herein pertain only to maintenance operations on this repository.  The [configuration](https://github.com/yahoo/state-space-packaging/blob/master/README.md#Configuration) steps for the full project are with the [State Space packaging](https://github.com/yahoo/state-space-packaging).

The customary installation location for the State Space components supporting IAB PrivacyChain is `/opt/iab/privacychain` but you may configure the build to use some other location.

## Configuration

The build system is based upon [GNU Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/index.html).

The configuration of the repo consists of two steps which must be done once.
1. `./buildconf`
2. `./configure`

The first step performs some crude assessments of the build environment and creates the site-specific `configure'. Of course `configure --help` will explain the build options.  The general options to `configure` are widely [documented](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Configuration.html).

The `buildconf` component is boilerplate and can be updated from [temerarious-flagship](https://github.com/yahoo/temerarious-flagship/blob/master/bc/template.autotools-buildconf) as needed.  The [Tunitas Build System](https://github.com/yahoo/temerarious-flagship) should be available in `/opt/tunitas` and the template at `/opt/tunitas/share/temerarious-flagship/bc/template.autotools-buildconf`

## Build

The simplest configure-compile-install recipe is:

``` bash
./buildconf &&
./configure &&
make all &&
make check &&
make install &&
echo OK DONE
```

## Usage

This package produces libraries (a.k.a. <em>a software development kit</em>).  It must be used with other components to make a complete system.

The [packaging](https://github.com/yahoo/state-space-packaging]) contains more detail on how to build the whole system as well as instructions for packaging and deployment of such a system not bare metal or in containers.

## Security

This project does not have any specific security concerns.  As always, the integrity of the build process is a requirement for the integrity in the deployment and operations phases.

The documentation on the [Security Model](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/security_model.html) of Hyperledger Fabric should be consulted prior to deployment. Additional background information on the [Certificate Authority](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/) system of Hyperledger Fabric (v1.4) can be found in the general documentation.

As always, before you deploy code into a production-facing environment you should review access and capability grants which have been established for your installation.
